# Soldering the CHIP Single Board Color Computer

Step 1: The Resistors<br>

Resistors are not polarized so they can be installed either direction. I like to start with the 100ohm resistors and work my way up to the 10K ohm resistors. The gold band is the percentage of accuracy. To read a resistor, start at the opposite side of the gold band.

100 ohm - brown black brown (QTY4)<br>
220 ohm – red yellow brown (QTY 4)<br>
470 ohm – yellow violet brown (QTY 3)<br>
10K ohm – brown black orange (QTY 4)<br>

Bend the metal wires at a 90 degree angle on each side of the resistor body. Place the resistor into the resistor location until it is flush with the PCB. Turn the board over holding the resistor in its place and bend the wires outward just slightly so the resistor can not back out of the holes. While the bottom of the board is facing up flat on your workspace, solder each of the two wires on the resistor. Make sure your solder stays only on the resistor wire and the hole. Cut the excess lead off the resistor. Repeat this procedure for all of the resistors.

Step 2: The crystal<br>

The 5MHZ crystal is not polarized and can be installed in either direction. Install flush with the PCB, hold the crystal and bend the leads apart slightly to keep the crystal from falling out. Turn the board over and solder the leads. Cut the excess lead length off flush with the PCB.

Step 3: The power switch<br>

![switch](https://github.com/Retrotink/PockeTerm-II/assets/121696513/642d63f3-f5c4-475c-b182-04beb929ad56)

Install switch into its location. Make sure the slide part of the switch faces away from the PCB. When flush with the PCB, turn over holding the switch from falling out and place on your workspace. Solder down all 6 posts making sure no solder flows across to the other tabs. Then solder the outter support posts.<br>

Step 4: Install the RESET Button

![5](https://github.com/Retrotink/CHIP/assets/121696513/d1a10400-a222-433b-810e-f33bb514a673)

The RESET Button is slightly rectangular in shape so you can not install it incorrectly. Place the switch flush with the PCB, hold the button while turning over the board. If you bend the tabs slightly inwards the button will hug onto the board. Solder all 4 tabs and make sure the button is as flush as possible. 

Step 5: The IC sockets<br>

![socket](https://github.com/Retrotink/PockeTerm-II/assets/121696513/30c07d55-07e7-40dc-ac42-17c071c2a6b0)

On the shorter edge of the socket is a notch showing you the direction to install the socket. Place the 40 pin large socket flush onto the PCB. Holding the socket, flip the board over and set on your workspace. Solder 2 pins on opposite corners and turn the board over and make sure the socket is flush with the PCB. Heat and adjust if needed. Solder the other 38 pins. Check for completeness of all the pins. If you accidentally install the socket backwards, it will still work just correctly. Just remember when you go to install the chips that the notch is at the wrong end. Repeat for the other 2 smaller 8 pin DIP sockets.

Step 6: Install the SD Card connector board

![6](https://github.com/Retrotink/CHIP/assets/121696513/71b6ad80-15ca-4312-8dd1-92e20a4c5fca)

The SD Card board has 6 pins that need to go into the board so the socket faces out over the edge of the board. While holding the SD Card board, turn the CHIP PCB over and carefully place the board on the table. Solder 1 pin down and turn the board over and verify the SD Board is flush to the CHIP PCB (adjust if necessary). Solder the remaining pins down and verify that the SD Card board is finished.

Step 7: The USB PC Serial Power Connector <br>

![7](https://github.com/Retrotink/CHIP/assets/121696513/1219ae3d-00ef-4478-bc32-f23d3140a92e)

The USB Power connector has 6 pins and when placed onto CHIP SBC board may be slightly elevated from the front edge. Make sure the connector is completely inserted before beginning soldering

Step 8: .1uF capacitors<br>

![cap 1](https://github.com/Retrotink/PockeTerm-II/assets/121696513/b4f1ca5c-9019-4a8d-b8e1-dcfbb06bebc8)

Install the two .1uF (C1-C5) caps into their locations. The caps are labeled 104 and are not polarized so they can be installed either way. Fit as flush as possible, bend the 2 wires apart a little so the capacitor does not fall out, turn the board over and set it on your workspace. Solder the leads onto the PCB and cut away the excess lead length.

Step 9: .01uF capacitor <br>
![cap 01](https://github.com/Retrotink/PockeTerm-II/assets/121696513/ffa5ab7a-6fa5-4246-9df7-4ea65dda23fc)

Install the .01uF capacitor C6 into its location. The capacitor is labeled 103 and is not polarized so it can be installed either direction. Fit as flush as possible, bend the 2 wires apart a little so the capacitor does not fall out, turn the board over and set it on your workspace. Solder the leads onto the PCB and cut the excess lead length.

Step 10: Install the 2N4401 Transistor by following the board shape for the half circle. Like the capacitors, bend the outter leads slightly away from the center one to hold it in place. Get it as close to the pcb as possible, then fliip the board over and solder down.
