# Soldering the CHIP Single Board Color Computer

Step 1: The Resistors<br>

Resistors are not polarized so they can be installed either direction. I like to start with the 100ohm resistors and work my way up to the 10K ohm resistors. The gold band is the percentage of accuracy. To read a resistor, start at the opposite side of the gold band.

100 ohm - brown black brown (QTY4)<br>
220 ohm – red yellow brown (QTY 4)<br>
470 ohm – yellow violet brown (QTY 3)<br>
10K ohm – brown black orange (QTY 4)<br>

Bend the metal wires at a 90 degree angle on each side of the resistor body. Place the resistor into the resistor location until it is flush with the PCB. Turn the board over holding the resistor in its place and bend the wires outward just slightly so the resistor can not back out of the holes. While the bottom of the board is facing up flat on your workspace, solder each of the two wires on the resistor. Make sure your solder stays only on the resistor wire and the hole. Cut the excess lead off the resistor. Repeat this procedure for all of the resistors.

Step 2: The crystal<br>

The 5MHZ crystal is not polarized and can be installed in either direction. Install flush with the PCB, hold the crystal and bend the leads apart slightly to keep the crystal from falling out. Turn the board over and solder the leads. Cut the excess lead length off flush with the PCB.

Step 3: The IC sockets<br>

![socket](https://github.com/Retrotink/PockeTerm-II/assets/121696513/30c07d55-07e7-40dc-ac42-17c071c2a6b0)

On the shorter edge of the socket is a notch showing you the direction to install the socket. Place the 40 pin large socket flush onto the PCB. Holding the socket, flip the board over and set on your workspace. Solder 2 pins on opposite corners and turn the board over and make sure the socket is flush with the PCB. Heat and adjust if needed. Solder the other 38 pins. Check for completeness of all the pins. If you accidentally install the socket backwards, it will still work just correctly. Just remember when you go to install the chips that the notch is at the wrong end. Repeat for the other 2 smaller 8 pin DIP sockets.
