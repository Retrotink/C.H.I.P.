Resistors are not polarized so they can be installed either direction. I like to start with the 100ohm resistors and work my way up to the 10K ohm resistors. The gold band is the percentage of accuracy. To read a resistor, start at the opposite side of the gold band.

100 ohm - brown black brown (QTY4)<br>
220 ohm – red yellow brown (QTY 5)<br>
470 ohm – yellow violet brown (QTY 3)<br>
10K ohm – brown black orange (QTY 4)<br>

Bend the metal wires at a 90 degree angle on each side of the resistor body. Place the resistor into the resistor location until it is flush with the PCB. Turn the board over holding the resistor in its place and bend the wires outward just slightly so the resistor can not back out of the holes. While the bottom of the board is facing up flat on your workspace, solder each of the two wires on the resistor. Make sure your solder stays only on the resistor wire and the hole. Cut the excess lead off the resistor. Repeat this procedure for all of the resistors.

Step 2: The crystal<br>
![crystal](https://github.com/Retrotink/PockeTerm-II/assets/121696513/4f4d3fd7-b99a-4a5b-a0d3-b7fdda44819b)

![3](https://github.com/Retrotink/CHIP/assets/121696513/46e78437-a664-4547-91f5-8eda8b3f56e6)


The 5MHZ crystal is not polarized and can be installed in either direction. Install flush with the PCB, hold the crystal and bend the leads apart slightly to keep the crystal from falling out. Turn the board over and solder the leads. Cut the excess lead length off flush with the PCB.

Step 3: The power switch<br>

![switch](https://github.com/Retrotink/PockeTerm-II/assets/121696513/642d63f3-f5c4-475c-b182-04beb929ad56)

![4](https://github.com/Retrotink/CHIP/assets/121696513/3bf84359-f955-4a94-b3a3-8cfa018e82e7)


Install switch into its location. Make sure the slide part of the switch faces away from the PCB. When flush with the PCB, turn over holding the switch from falling out and place on your workspace. Solder down all 6 posts making sure no solder flows across to the other tabs. Then solder the outter support posts.<br>

Step 4: Install the RESET Button

![5](https://github.com/Retrotink/CHIP/assets/121696513/d1a10400-a222-433b-810e-f33bb514a673)

The RESET Button is slightly rectangular in shape so you can not install it incorrectly. Place the switch flush with the PCB, hold the button while turning over the board. If you bend the tabs slightly inwards the button will hug onto the board. Solder all 4 tabs and make sure the button is as flush as possible. 

Step 5: The IC sockets<br>

![socket](https://github.com/Retrotink/PockeTerm-II/assets/121696513/30c07d55-07e7-40dc-ac42-17c071c2a6b0)

On the shorter edge of the socket is a notch showing you the direction to install the socket. Place the 40 pin large socket flush onto the PCB. Holding the socket, flip the board over and set on your workspace. Solder 2 pins on opposite corners and turn the board over and make sure the socket is flush with the PCB. Heat and adjust if needed. Solder the other 38 pins. Check for completeness of all the pins. If you accidentally install the socket backwards, it will still work just correctly. Just remember when you go to install the chips that the notch is at the wrong end. Repeat for the other 2 smaller 8 pin DIP sockets.

Step 6: Install the SD Card connector board

![6](https://github.com/Retrotink/CHIP/assets/121696513/71b6ad80-15ca-4312-8dd1-92e20a4c5fca)

The SD Card board has 6 pins that need to go into the board so the socket faces out over the edge of the board. While holding the SD Card board, turn the CHIP PCB over and carefully place the board on the table. Solder 1 pin down and turn the board over and verify the SD Board is flush to the CHIP PCB (adjust if necessary). Solder the remaining pins down and verify that the SD Card board is finished.

Step 7: The USB PC Serial Power Connector <br>

![7](https://github.com/Retrotink/CHIP/assets/121696513/1219ae3d-00ef-4478-bc32-f23d3140a92e)

The USB Power connector has 6 pins and when placed onto CHIP SBC board may be slightly elevated from the front edge. Make sure the connector is completely inserted before beginning soldering

Step 8: Install the Audio Connector <br>

![audio](https://github.com/Retrotink/CHIP/assets/121696513/53d8ebd9-a5a1-4888-832e-bdc716aceffc)

Insert the Audio Connector with the female plug facing out away from the pcb. While holding the audio connector, turn the board over and lay on the table to solder down. Solder 1 pin down then turn over to check that the connector is flush with the pcb. If not. heat the pin that was just soldered while applying pressure to the connector to get it down flush. Solder the remaining pins on the connector.

Step 9: .1uF capacitors<br>

![cap 1](https://github.com/Retrotink/PockeTerm-II/assets/121696513/b4f1ca5c-9019-4a8d-b8e1-dcfbb06bebc8)

Install the two .1uF (C1-C5) caps into their locations. The caps are labeled 104 and are not polarized so they can be installed either way. Fit as flush as possible, bend the 2 wires apart a little so the capacitor does not fall out, turn the board over and set it on your workspace. Solder the leads onto the PCB and cut away the excess lead length.

Step 10: .01uF capacitor <br>
![cap 01](https://github.com/Retrotink/PockeTerm-II/assets/121696513/ffa5ab7a-6fa5-4246-9df7-4ea65dda23fc)

Install the .01uF capacitor C6 into its location. The capacitor is labeled 103 and is not polarized so it can be installed either direction. Fit as flush as possible, bend the 2 wires apart a little so the capacitor does not fall out, turn the board over and set it on your workspace. Solder the leads onto the PCB and cut the excess lead length.

Step 11: Install the 2N4401 Transistor<br>
![transistor](https://github.com/Retrotink/PockeTerm-II/assets/121696513/5f2d2f0a-00b0-4b07-baf8-7dfe22e6a85a)

Follow the board shape for the half circle for correct orientation. Like the capacitors, bend the outter leads slightly away from the center one to hold it in place. Get it as close to the pcb as possible, then flip the board over and solder down. Trim the excess of the leads off

![11](https://github.com/Retrotink/CHIP/assets/121696513/c70d0639-4522-4d61-a0c0-42ae68f3eccd)

Step 12: VGA connector<br>

![vga](https://github.com/Retrotink/PockeTerm-II/assets/121696513/09b62c6e-56cd-4fdc-ab0c-45e3034e3894)

The VGA is nearly the same as the DB9 serial port except it has 3 rows of pins. Insert flush with PCB, turn and solder the inside row first, followed by the outer 2 rows. Check your work, and then solder the support tabs down.

![12](https://github.com/Retrotink/CHIP/assets/121696513/95c3892c-5649-4dff-bac0-5a578d81d2ab)

Step 13: 10uF electrolytic capacitors<br>

![cap10](https://github.com/Retrotink/PockeTerm-II/assets/121696513/c7e23a6e-7e4a-4e91-b1af-82b1a7c92350)

The 3 electrolytic capacitors C7-C9 are polarized and must be installed correctly. They are cylinder shaped and both leads protrude from the same side and are labeled 10uF. There are two ways to tell the + and - leads. First, looking at the leads, the positive lead is longer than the negative lead. Secondly, there is a large white arrow pointing to the - lead. Install flush with the PCB and bend the two leads slightly apart from one another. Turn the board over and solder onto the PCB. Cut the excess lead and repeat for the other 2 capacitors.

Step 14: PS/2 keyboard connector<br>

![ps2](https://github.com/Retrotink/PockeTerm-II/assets/121696513/4714c28a-69ef-4dac-a793-3360bb58dc8d)

Install this part slow and carefully. If the pins are not lined up, they will push back and not go through the pcb. Place connector flush onto the PCB and hold while turning over to keep it from falling out. Place on workspace and solder onto the board. You may wish to solder just the large tab first and check to make sure it is flush before soldering the other pins down.

![13](https://github.com/Retrotink/CHIP/assets/121696513/179db92b-9d87-4fe9-97c9-23a94d0c6288)

Step 15: The cleanup

Optional: Before you power up your board, it is recommended that you wash off the excess flux and check for any missed solder connections. I like to clean with plain water and a soft tooth brush. Run under the tap water for a minute washing off excess flux. Dry immediately with a blow dryer on low heat. You can also use canned or compressed air in place of blow dryer.

Step 16: Initial power test

Install the IC chips; connect a keyboard and VGA monitor. Plug in your CHIP to a wall power suppy after everything is connected. The USB will also show the RED LED on to show that power is coming into the unit. Turn on your CHIP computer and you should get a text log message at the top of your screen. The keyboard will also blink as it is powered on. If you don't get anything, turn off the computer and recheck your connections.
